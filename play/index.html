<h3>the story</h3>
<p>
  heynow dance is a free dance show put on in the Somerville/Cambridge area aimed at making live dance as comfortable and engaging as live music. The show is put on roughly once per season and features local dancers and musicians presenting new ideas. Besides making the website to index each season's program with videos and photos, I also get to dabble with some video editing both for archiving and presenting at the shows. The design has some interesting uses of map tags for playful navigation between seasons.
