<h3>the story</h3>
<p>
  I'm currently teaching a JavaScript class at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education <a href="http://www.ccae.org">(CCAE)</a>. I was pulled in at the last minute to teach but the thought I've been trying to put into practice is running the entire class as an open source project, which I named <a href="http://www.github.com/abgoldstein/ccaejs">ccaeJS</a>. The basic idea is to have one project that uses the technologies it teaches for materials so that lectures, notes, assignments, and answers can all grow with the class. I gave all of the students a basic git cheatsheet so that they can push their work and answers back to me, which I pull in along with the next week's materials for the beginning of each class. I'm using slidesJS to present content, basic Twitter Bootstrap style for notes, and assigning a combination of <a href="codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">CodeAcademy</a> tracks and my own exercises to actually get the code in everyone's fingers. ccaeJS is very much a work in progress but I'm really enjoying it as we go and hope to continue improving it as I re-teach the course.
