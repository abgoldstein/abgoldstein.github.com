<h3>the story</h3>
<p>
  A friend of mine has run a landscaping company with his brothers since he was in high school and they decided it was time to have a website. As a trade, I built him one, and he helped me to clear part of my backyard for my first ever garden. I'm still waiting to get some content from them, but the site should be up and about soon.
