<h3>the story</h3>
<p>
  Connector is a two-man electronic band based in the Boston area. As they're starting to play more shows, they wanted a very simplistic website to index all of their demos and events. They work with a lot of other interesting musicians and performers so they wanted a site they could easily edit themselves, so I made them a template for content just out of a github project page.
