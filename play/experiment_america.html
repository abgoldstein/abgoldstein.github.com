<h3>the idea</h3>
<p>
  As part of the Emerging America Festival, Experiment America was an immersive art event held at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. The exhibit was lead by Mikhael Tara Garver in collaboration with more than 50 writers, dancers, actors, and performers. The night included music, dancing, and technology to include everyone attending in the experience.

<h3>the story</h3>
<p>
  I actually didn't meet Mikhael or anyone involved with this project until about a week before the event. This opportunity stumbled into me and I ended up quickly writing an activity for a computer lab inside the museum. Based on some restrictions of the lab, it turned out that we needed to use embedded web cams using flash in IE8 in kiosk mode which then stored the photos in an EC2 instance. It was a pretty frantic couple of days but a very interesting event to be a part of.
