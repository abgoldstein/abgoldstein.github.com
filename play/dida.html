<h3>the story</h3>
<p>
  Melissa Riling is an artist based in Philadelphia who goes by the name Dida B. Quick. Her artwork generally consists of drawing, water color painting, collage, sewing, dyeing, gluing, and experimenting. More recently she has been involved in the fashion world. Melissa wanted something that would be very simple to update to produce a stream of photos, so I just put some CSS and JavaScript on top of a tumblr account and now she's posting away and selling some of her uploaded work.
