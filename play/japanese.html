		      When I started as a Freshman at Brandeis University, I had never taken any Japanese lessons before, but I was determined to learn the language and I announced to my family and friends that I would be studying abroad there come Junior year. That might have seemed a bit over enthusiastic, but once my introductary class started, it was a whirlwind of flashcards, practicing my reading, writing, speaking, and listening. After one week, we had learned hiragana, one of the two phoenetic Japanese alphabets. After three weeks, I could read the other phoenetic alphabet, katakana, as well. By the end of the semester, I knew my first handful of kanji, a couple of songs, and could sound my way through basic dialogues. Suddenly it's six years later, and I'm still fascinated; I've lived in the country for a year, I can read books and newspapers, and I'm able to stay in touch with my home stay family over the phone. Probably the most touching thing to me about the journey of studying Japanese is the overwhelming kindness that I've encountered from friends, family, and teachers all along the way, bonded together over love of a beautiful language and culture. Here I'd like to share a little bit of that.
		      
		      After returning from studying abroad, I was more than excited to keep pushing forward and learning more Japanese. There was one semester of more advanced Japanese taught at Brandeis, which I took, but then there weren't any courses left. I started an independent study with my sensei from before I had ever left and we came up with a routine to get me more practice. I would read Japanese newspapers online, short stories, and poems and twice a week we would meet to discuss it all. My sensei wanted me to practice actually expressing myself and really establish my own voice in this foreign language, so the end of the semester goal was to write a speech that I could deliver at the 2009 Boston Japanese Speech Contest (ボストン近郊日本語スピーチ発表会). The event was held at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. The title of my speech was "見知らぬ人の親切 (The Kindness of Strangers)". With the support and encouragement of my sensei, I wrote and rewrote the talk so that it could be a story about something important to me and so that I could deliver it in a way that captured my personality and voice in Japanese.
		      
		      My sensei treated me to dinner after the speech contest and again I had a chance to reminisce with someone very important to me. Throughout the four years, any conversation with my sensei ended with her telling me what I needed to work on next or how I needed to study harder. It sometimes could make things feel impossible or as if all of my attempts were just futile. At that dinner, and in a very touching letter she sent me later on, my sensei told me how proud she was of me and how well I had done. Now when I look back on that night, I worry that I would disappoint my sensei for hardly practicing in the last two years while earning my Master's at an engineering school. When I talk with my host mom on the phone now, sometimes my Japanese is slow to dust off and start back up, like some sort of long neglected car. But I know I'll keep moving. Every sensei who ever taught me told me that the language is a life long journey and just because classes are over does not mean that I'm done. In the same way, once college ended and there were no more varsity soccer teams in my future, I kept playing and kept exercising. When I was in Japan and my focus was not on Computer Science, I still found an opportunity to program, an outlet for that part of me. The kindness I've found while learning Japanese is a treasure that I've found unites any group of people that have a common passion and Japanese helps me to remember that in all things I care about I will be a life long learner.
