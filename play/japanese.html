<h3>the beginning</h3>
<p>
  When I was a Freshman at Brandeis University, I started learning Japanese my first semester. I got the chance to study abroad at Kyoto University as a part of the Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies (<a href="http://www.kcjs.jp/">KCJS</a>) for a year and I was lucky enough to live with a wonderful host family with whom I still keep in touch. Those four years were my first real applications of programming outside of school and work, which led to little projects like iterations of flash card programs (called Ultra Study Fun Time Turbo) and a translation website.

<h3>the story</h3>
<p>
  My senior year at Brandeis, I got the chance to participate in the 2009 Boston Japanese Speech Contest (ボストン近郊日本語スピーチ発表会). The event was held at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. The title of my speech was "見知らぬ人の親切 (The Kindness of Strangers)".
