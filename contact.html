		        Traditionally, I'm a back-end software developer but recently I've been trying to learn and play with design to try and stay as hip to the full stack as possible. This website is meant to briefly show what I'm currently up to on both ends. The projects I keep here tend to be recent and are by no means exhaustive, so I would be happy to share any materials from work or research that I mention but don't have posted.
		      </p>
		      <p>
		        I'm primarily interested in healthcare and education, which is what you'll find in the work section here, but I also enjoy taking on small projects to help friends involved with music and dance, art and community, or personal businesses and hobbies to find their place on the internet. It turns out not everyone spends as much time on the internet as me but there are a lot of people involved in fascinating things that I can help share, which becomes a great excuse to keep up with technology.
		      </p>
		      <p>
		        My goal in life is to help people around the world to be healthy, have better access to information and education, and share in one another and their endeavors across boundaries of language and culture. Please feel free to get in touch with me any time about any work opportunities, good ideas, or interesting projects. Hopefully we can connect and grow!
		      </P>
