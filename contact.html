    I am a full stack web developer with a focus on healthcare and education. Right now, I work on open source web and mobile applications to help advance HealthIT. Before that, I developed an intelligent tutoring system for math and researched in the field of educational data mining to help students learn effectively. I am always looking to grow as a computer scientist to embrace modern web technologies to empower people, and I am very passionate about the open, collaborative philosophy supporting that development.

    This website is meant to briefly show what I'm currently doing. The projects I keep here tend to be recent and are by no means exhaustive, so I would be happy to share any materials from work or research that I mention but don't have posted.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal in life is to help people around the world to be healthy, have better access to information and education, and share in one another and their endeavors across boundaries of language and culture. Please feel free to get in touch with me any time about any work opportunities, good ideas, or interesting projects. Hopefully we can connect and grow!
  </P>
