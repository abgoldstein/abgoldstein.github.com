<h3>let me tell you about this blog</h3>
<p>
  Hello. I have a blog.

  Here's the reason I'm keeping a blog.

  I'm going to write about these topics.

  This is the approach I'm going to use as a writing routine.

  I'm not going to do categories. Well, I am, but more useful I'm going to label blog posts with an intended audience. I think that'll help my brain focus in a specific scope for my voice.
