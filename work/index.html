<h3>the elevator pitch</h3>
<p>
  hReader is a patient-centric family health manager. The goal is to securely collect and capture the patientâ€™s entire health care record to make it easy for them to understand and engage with their own health. By helping patients understand their individual health data as well as their family's status, and by providing a mobile platform to access that data, hReader seeks to improve the communication between patients, family members, and health care providers. This should engage and empower patients to improve their health, with better results, at a lower cost.

<h3>the cool parts i personally did</h3>
<p>
  I contributed to some of the applets that display health data, including some in native Objective-C like recent test results and conditions, as well as HTML/CSS applets like the timeline and popHealth. For <a href="http://www.himssconference.org/">HIMSS 2013</a>, we demonstrated how we could use Restful Health Exchange <a href="http://wiki.siframework.org/RHEx">(RHEx)</a> to pull patient history from multiple providers. I implemented an authorization code OAuth2 workflow with OpenID Connect to enable the demonstration that we ran at the interoperability showcase.
