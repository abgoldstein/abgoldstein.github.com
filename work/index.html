<h3>the elevator pitch</h3>
<p>
  hReader is a patient-centric family health manager. The goal is to securely collect and capture the patientâ€™s entire health care record to make it easy for them to understand and engage with their own health. By helping patients understand their individual health data as well as their family's status, and by providing a mobile platform to access that data, hReader seeks to improve the communication between patients, family members, and health care providers. This should engage and empower patients to improve their health, with better results, at a lower cost.
