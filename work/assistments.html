<h3>the elevator pitch</h3>
<p>
  ASSISTments is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system">Intelligent Tutoring System</a> that is led by Professor Heffernan at WPI. The website is in use by over 10,000 students, primarily in the New England area for learning middle and high school mathematics. As an NSF GK-12 PIMSE fellow, I spent about 15 hours per week helping teachers at a Worcester, MA middle school teach their math classes with a formative assessment cycle that is driven by data collected in ASSISTments. Since I left, the project has started exploring the Google Web Toolkit and has been featured in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/magazine/how-computerized-tutors-are-learning-to-teach-humans.html">New York Times</a>.

<h3>the cool parts i personally did</h3>
<p>
  Part of the research for my Master's thesis led me to implement Bayesian Knowledge Tracing in ASSISTments. I augmented the tutor so that we could use models from the lab's research to dictate when an assignment would be completed. I allowed teachers to set a threshold for the knowledge tracing to test out a student and also implemented my own model that attempted to detect the exact moment of learning. I also served as lab manager for the second half of my program, which included guiding content builders and programmers and maintaining our source control and releases on top of usual development.
