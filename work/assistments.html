		      <h3>what i do</h3>
		      I am a 2nd year Computer Science Master's student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I began this program immediately after getting my Bachelor's degree from Brandeis University in CS and East Asian Studies, with a focus on Japanese. Aside from my classes, which tend to revolve around Artificial Intelligence concepts, I work with Professors Neil Heffernan and Ryan Baker as an RA, NSF GK-12 PIMSE Fellow, and Ruby on Rails/Java developer.

          In my role as a developer, I help to maintain and expand upon ASSISTments, an Intelligent Tutoring System that is led by Professor Heffernan here at WPI. The website is in use by about 10,000 students, primarily in the New England area for learning middle and high school mathematics. As a PIMSE fellow, I spend about 15 hours a week helping teachers at a Worcester, MA middle school teach their math classes with a formative assessment cycle that is driven by data collected in ASSISTments. Currently, our system is written in Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database, but we are refactoring the project to be run with the Google Web Toolkit and MySQL.

		      Developed in Ruby on Rails for ASSISTments, an Intelligent Tutoring System primarily used for Math.
          Programmed many bug fixes, features, and UI improvements, including:
          Improved precision of logging user actions to support synchronization with Android devices.
          Redesigned and implemented UIs for tutor class creation and content building systems.
          Currently implementing Bayesian Knowledge Tracing linked between Ruby and Java GWT systems.
          Worked as lab manager for the system in 2010:
          Managed several undergraduates, delegating tasks and overseeing progress of 2 content builders and 6 programmers. Assisted with initial designs, creating mock-ups, and planning for test cases.
          Maintained SVN, both to manage site updates and also to allow different levels of access to our secure versioning server.
          Created a developer's image for Windows 7 boxes and wrote a batch file and shell script for environment setup for external developers.
          Documentation: Wrote an XML/XSL list of all Ruby gems on the production servers, wrote guides for how to update nginx, PostgreSQL, and firewall configuration.
          The ASSISTments platform is written in Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database run on several FreeBSD 7.2 servers. The website is an Intelligent Tutoring System, primarily used for Mathematics. The ITS field is young but very rapidly developing; Our site serves about 10,000 students, mostly in the New England area, and we have been doubling the user base every year since the system's inception.

          Working on ASSISTments has been an invaluable learning experience for me. All developers report in directly to Professor Heffernan who is our boss and academic adviser to many of us. Professor Heffernan is an extremely enthusiastic leader who encourages initiative so the project has a very rapid development cycle as compared to some previous jobs I've held. One part of software development that appeals to me very much is the design process and creating clear UIs, so I frequently chose tasks to try to make the experience using our website more consistent and smooth.

          During 2010, I became the lab manager for our team. I maintained a bug tracker with outstanding problems and feature requests and used it to delegate tasks to about six undergraduates. This process included an initial planning phase where I would help with design work, mock-up creation, and imagining test cases. I also directed two undergraduates who focused on content creation for our system. In this role as lab manager, I spent a lot of time trying to fill in important gaps in our documentation. Our development team changes very rapidly because it is made up primarily by graduate students, and we have a finite number of years at the school. With that in mind, I think it is especially important to document our process, environment and decisions; I wrote out what is necessary to run our specific RoR environment, documented how to update important backend services, such as NGINX, PostgreSQL, and our firewall, and I heavily pushed our tracker system. The entire experience has given me significant insight into design phases, system internals, front end development, as well as how project leadership works, and I think I will be graduating as a mature developer.
