<h3>the elevator pitch</h3>
<p>
  Cypress is an open source testing tool that can be used to verify the accurate calculation of Meaningful Use Clinical Quality Measures. The idea is to enable repeatable testing of an EHR Vendor's ability to accurately calculate CQMs. Cypress supports both EHR vendors and the testing community in order to make testing the accuracy of Meaningful Use Clinical Quality Measure calculations easier.

<h3>the cool parts i personally did</h3>
<p>
  Cypress was my first excuse to play around with Amazon Web Services. In preparation for the HIMSS conference, I refactored the code base to add history and exportable artifacts and created an EC2 AMI to run Cypress for EHR Vendor's to clone and deploy. Cypress was also my first excuse to play around with Twitter Bootstrap via Sass.
